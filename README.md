# ASCII Art

This is an advanced beginners guided project, taken [robertheaton.com](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/).

The idea here was to turn images into ASCII-art.

# Instructions

The script is fairly simple. All you need to do is download the script to your PC. Before running it, change the path variable on line **118** to a jpg of your choosing.

Once this is complete, run the script via your Terminal or Command window.

When you run the script, you'll have some options to choose from. Try playing around with these:

* Invert (yes or no)
* Brightness Type (Average, Lightness, Luminosity)
* Filter Type (Default, Blue, Green)

Once you've run through these options, an ASCII image will be printed. Zoom out and enjoy!!

# What I Learned

Here I developed some additional skills around some basic programming concepts/structures such as conditional statements, loops, and arrays. 

I also developed my debugging skills, as it took a long time before I got my script right.
